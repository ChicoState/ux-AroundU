# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

AroundU is an app that allows users to browse upcoming and ongoing local events. It shows the time, date, and distance of events relative to the user. The app is designed to help users find activities and connect with others in their community.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!
From class notes: Research methods = Competitive Analyis and Hueristic Evaluation

## Findings

Through competitive analysis, our team found that there are several products in the event discovery space, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Products like Yelp and TripAdvisor have broad user bases, providing many reviews and helping users plan events, but they tend to focus on more popular locations and large-scale events. Yelp excels in popular cities, but may not serve users in smaller towns as effectively. Similarly, while TripAdvisor is good for planning multiple events for a trip, it lacks in offering local, community-focused events. Our analysis revealed that AroundU could fill a gap in the market by targeting users seeking local events, particularly those that are lesser-known and more community-oriented. The target demographic for AroundU includes individuals of all ages who are looking to explore new activities. Particularly people who may be new to an area, or people who want to become more involved. This can include a broad range of people like university students, travelers, young professionals, and families.

During our hueristic evaluation, we found that TripAdvisor scored very well in key areas such as 'visibility of system status' with 9, 'match between system and the real world' with 9, and 'aesthetic and minimalist design' with 9 thanks to its clear navigation, layout, and simple design. In order for AroundU to be a comptetitor, we found that it will also need to be very intuitive for the user, with a aesthetic and pleasent design.

Personas and scenarios provided further insight into why users would use AroundU. We found that users want easy-to-use features that allow them to find a wide range of unique events around them.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
