# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

AroundU is an app that allows users to browse upcoming and ongoing local events. It shows the time, date, and distance of events relative to the user. The app is designed to help users find activities and connect with others in their community.

## Methods

For our analysis on AroundU, we used a variety of methods to understand current event discovery platforms and find areas for improvement. Our first approach was competitive analysis, where we looked at several apps in the event discovery space to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. The UX team focused on key competitors like Yelp and TripAdvisor, each known for specific features. We categorized these platforms based on criteria such as strengths, weaknesses, quality, and price. Although we also considered the types of platforms and features offered, these factors played a smaller role in the overall evaluation. 

  

We also conducted a heuristic evaluation, focusing on TripAdvisor for a more detailed analysis after the competitive review. The goal of this evaluation was to examine usability factors like app controls, visual appeal, user freedom, and error prevention. TripAdvisor was chosen for its solid interface and similarity to AroundU's initial ideas. In this evaluation, we scored TripAdvisor on a scale from 1 to 10 in various areas: visibility of system status, match with real world expectations, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, ease of use, aesthetic design, support for error recovery, and help documentation. We took notes to identify strengths and weaknesses in each area. 

## Findings

Through competitive analysis, our team found that there are several products in the event discovery space, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Products like Yelp and TripAdvisor have broad user bases, providing many reviews and helping users plan events, but they tend to focus on more popular locations and large scale events. Yelp excels in popular cities, but may not serve users in smaller towns as effectively. Similarly, while TripAdvisor is good for planning multiple events for a trip, it lacks in offering local, community focused events. Our analysis revealed that AroundU could fill a gap in the market by targeting users seeking local events, particularly those that are smaller and more community based. The target demographic for AroundU includes individuals of all ages who are looking to explore new activities. Particularly people who may be new to an area, or people who want to become more involved. This can include a broad range of people like university students, travelers, young professionals, and families.

During our hueristic evaluation, we found that TripAdvisor scored very well in key areas such as 'visibility of system status' with 9, 'match between system and the real world' with 9, and 'aesthetic and minimalist design' with 9 thanks to its clear navigation, layout, and simple design. In order for AroundU to be a comptetitor, we found that it will also need to be very intuitive for the user, with a aesthetic and pleasent design. We also identified that while TripAdvisor excels in many areas, there are opportunities to improve user control and freedom, such as avoiding extra tabs. Addressing these areas could give AroundU a competitive edge by offering a more efficient experience.

## Conclusions

Our analysis of AroundU showed a clear opportunity to help users find local, community focused activities, especially compared to competitors like Yelp and TripAdvisor, which focus on popular events and places. We believe AroundU can attract a diverse group of users, including university students, travelers, young professionals, and families. To compete well, the app needs to be easy to navigate and visually appealing, with features that let users quickly discover unique local events and get personalized notifications. However, it's important to note that our insights are based on assumptions since we haven't gathered data from real users yet. Additionally, our limited experience in competitive analysis may affect our findings, and the wide range of potential users means their preferences may vary, requiring further research and feedback for ongoing improvements.

## Caveats

Some caveats we identified in our research are that we have not yet gathered data from actual users, and much of our analysis is based on assumptions about the target demographic. Additionally, our team has limited experience conducting competitive analysis and heuristic evaluations, which may have influenced our findings. Another limitation is the broad range of potential users for AroundU, especially since people new to an area or community can vary widely in preferences and needs.
