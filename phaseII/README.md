# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The AroundU app is designed to help users discover local events by showing relevant event details like time, date, and distance from the userâ€™s location, with the goal of connecting users to local activities. In phase II we aimed to address usability concerns identified in Phase I and from recent cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback. The key objectives were to enhance user navigation, improve visual aids, improve event filtering options, and ensure that event hosts have clear control over event information.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
