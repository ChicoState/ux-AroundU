# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The AroundU app is designed to help users discover local events by showing relevant event details like time, date, and distance from the userâ€™s location, with the goal of connecting users to local activities. In phase II we aimed to address usability concerns identified in Phase I and from recent cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback. The key objectives were to enhance user navigation, improve visual aids, improve event filtering options, and ensure that event hosts have clear control over event information.

## Methods

For this phase of our analysis on AroundU, we conducted a cognitive walkthrough with an external UX evaluator, a CSCI431W student (n=1). The evaluator followed a persona named Cruz to guide their experience through the app. The walkthrough involved assessing how well users could complete specific tasks without confusion, such as locating events on a map, filtering events by category, and securing a ticket.
The evaluator used the document [AroundU Cognitive Walkthrough](Cognitive Walkthrough - AroundU(Cruz).pdf/)
 following the streamlined two-question approach using the app's wireframe. This document details the steps for each task, the persona's goals, and questions to ask at each stage. The questions focused on whether the user understood each action, if there was adequate feedback for their choices, and any points of confusion or hesitation. Notes were taken on navigation confusion, lack of feedback cues, and areas where clearer guidance was needed.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
