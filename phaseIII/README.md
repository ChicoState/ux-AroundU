# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, we designed a usability evaluation to test the AroundU prototype and discover areas for improvement based on user interactions. The evaluation focused on completing key tasks such as creating/hosting an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets. Insights from this phase will guide more refinements to improve the user experience and ensure the app effectively connects users to local events.

## Methods

For this phase of our analysis on AroundU, we conducted a usibility test to evaluate key components of the user experience. We asked each user to complete three tasks which were creating an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing a ticket. After each task, the moderator checked if the user successfully completed it by marking a 'Yes' or 'No' checkbox. Then the user was asked to rate the difficulty of the task on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is 'very difficult' and 5 is 'very easy'. Finally the user was asked to explain the reasoning behind their ratings. These tasks were selected to test important UX components, including navigation clarity, intuitiveness, and feedback.

Our approach was summative and meant to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the app based on our final protocol. Participants were asked to "think aloud" as they interacted with the app sharing their thoughts, preferences, and any confusion. Each task was followed by questions to gather qualitative feedback and provide understanding of user behavior and expectations. This evaluation allowed us to assess the success of the design and discover any remaining areas for improvement. 

## Findings

The usability test for AroundU revealed that users found the core features simple and effective, with tasks like creating events, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets rated as 5 being easy to complete. This was an overall trend as 8/12 scores on all tasks were given a 5. However, users highlighted areas for improvement, such as enlarging buttons for better usability, making the interface more visually appealing, and refining navigation to display event locations on the map before ticket purchase. Key feature requests included adding a group chat for attendees, direct communication with event hosts, the ability to share events, integrated notifications, and a search bar on the map page. Addressing these needs will enhance the app's usability, engagement, and overall user experience.

## Conclusions

Our usability evaluation of AroundU provided valuable insights into both areas for improvement and affirmed design elements.

Participants highlighted the need for clearer feedback mechanisms. This includes confirming actions like creating a new event to reduce confusion. Additionally, users desired a more intuitive navigation making sure one can easily return to previous pages without losing context. Addressing these issues will help improve the user experience and make interactions more seamless.

Main design features, such as the straightforward layout, and intuitive task flows, received positive feedback. Participants enjoyed the simplicity of creating events, searching for results, and purchasing tickets. They described these actions as "easy" and "very simple". Users appreciated the clear organization of event information and the design confirming that these should remain as is. Together these findings emphasize both the opportunities for refinement and the strengths of AroundU.  

## Caveats

While the usability test gave us some great ideas for improving AroundU, there are a few things we need to keep in mind about the study. First, we didn’t test enough people to be sure that everyone who uses the app would feel the same way, especially since we might’ve missed some important groups of users. Also, since we asked users to do specific tasks, we might have focused too much on those and not noticed other problems that could show up when people use the app more casually or over time. Additionally, while users suggested several features like group chat, notifications, and the ability to contact event hosts, these ideas might not resonate with all users if they aren’t implemented in a way that fits the overall goal and design of AroundU. For example, if group chat feels clunky or overly complicated, it could frustrate users instead of enhancing their experience. Similarly, notifications, while helpful for some, could become annoying or overwhelming if not done thoughtfully. It's important to ensure that any new feature works seamlessly within the app's flow and supports its primary purpose, or it might detract from the user experience rather than improve it.
