# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, we designed a usability evaluation to test the AroundU prototype and discover areas for improvement based on user interactions. The evaluation focused on completing key tasks such as creating/hosting an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets. Insights from this phase will guide more refinements to improve the user experience and ensure the app effectively connects users to local events.

## Methods

For this phase of our analysis on AroundU, we conducted a usibility test. We asked each user to complete three tasks which were creating an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing a ticket. After each task was finished the moderator would check if they successfully completed the task by marking a 'Yes' or 'No' checkbox. Then the user was asked to rate the difficulty of the task on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is 'very difficult' and 5 is 'very easy'. Finally the user was asked to explain why they rated the score as they did.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
