# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, we designed a usability evaluation to test the AroundU prototype and discover areas for improvement based on user interactions. The evaluation focused on completing key tasks such as creating/hosting an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets. Insights from this phase will guide more refinements to improve the user experience and ensure the app effectively connects users to local events.

## Methods

For this phase of our analysis on AroundU, we conducted a usibility test to evaluate key components of the user experience. We asked each user to complete three tasks which were creating an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing a ticket. After each task, the moderator checked if the user successfully completed it by marking a 'Yes' or 'No' checkbox. Then the user was asked to rate the difficulty of the task on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is 'very difficult' and 5 is 'very easy'. Finally the user was asked to explain the reasoning behind their ratings. These tasks were selected to test important UX components, including navigation clarity, intuitiveness, and feedback.

Our approach was summative and meant to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the app based on our final protocol. Participants were asked to "think aloud" as they interacted with the app sharing their thoughts, preferences, and any confusion. Each task was followed by questions to gather qualitative feedback and provide understanding of user behavior and expectations. This evaluation allowed us to assess the success of the design and discover any remaining areas for improvement. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
