# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, we designed a usability evaluation to test the AroundU prototype and discover areas for improvement based on user interactions. The evaluation focused on completing key tasks such as creating/hosting an event, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets. Insights from this phase will guide more refinements to improve the user experience and ensure the app effectively connects users to local events.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
