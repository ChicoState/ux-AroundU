# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**


- Competitive analysis revealed chances to **reshape the event discovery market** by addressing important customer needs:  
   - `Yelp:` While strong in popular cities and for restaurant reviews, it **lacks coverage of events**, particularly in smaller or niche communities.  
   - `TripAdvisor:` Good for planning major trips and visiting tourist hotspots, but **weak in highlighting smaller**, localized events and activities.  
   - `Meetup:` Effective for organizing and joining events, but has limited variety and options in smaller towns, leaving opportunities for more local, community driven experiences.


- Heuristic evaluation revealed strengths in TripAdvisorâ€™s platform but also areas for improvement:

   - Searching: While TripAdvisor provides good system feedback, users may find it **challenging to search for local or niche events.**
   - Browsing categories: Users lack sufficient control over browsing event categories, limiting their ability to quickly find relevant events or sort by event types. 

- New personas and scenarios highlight key user experience insights for Around U:

   - Integrated platform: Around U **combines local event discovery with social and cultural activities**, offering diverse experiences.
   - Simplified exploration: Users can easily uncover unique events tailored to their interests, **offering an alternative options.**
   - Enhanced customization: The app gives users more options to **filter events based on personal preferences**, helping them avoid irrelevant activities and crowded venues.

- **Sketches and diagrams illustrate initial concepts:**

   - Visual flow for **discovering and attending events.**
   - Search with **event specific results** and easy navigation
   - User login, seat selection, and seamless ticket purchasing
