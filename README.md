# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**


- Competitive analysis revealed chances to **reshape the event discovery market** by addressing important customer needs:  
   - `Yelp:` While strong in popular cities and for restaurant reviews, it **lacks coverage of events**, particularly in smaller or niche communities.  
   - `TripAdvisor:` Good for planning major trips and visiting tourist hotspots, but **weak in highlighting smaller**, localized events and activities.  
   - `Meetup:` Effective for organizing and joining events, but has limited variety and options in smaller towns, leaving opportunities for more local, community driven experiences.


- Heuristic evaluation revealed strengths in TripAdvisor’s platform but also areas for improvement:

   - Searching: While TripAdvisor provides good system feedback, users may find it **challenging to search for local or niche events.**
   - Browsing categories: Users lack sufficient control over browsing event categories, limiting their ability to quickly find relevant events or sort by event types. 

- New personas and scenarios highlight key user experience insights for Around U:

   - Integrated platform: Around U **combines local event discovery with social and cultural activities**, offering diverse experiences.
   - Simplified exploration: Users can easily uncover unique events tailored to their interests, **offering an alternative options.**
   - Enhanced customization: The app gives users more options to **filter events based on personal preferences**, helping them avoid irrelevant activities and crowded venues.

- **Sketches and diagrams illustrate initial concepts:**

   - Visual flow for **discovering and attending events.**
   - Search with **event specific results** and easy navigation
   - User login, seat selection, and seamless ticket purchasing

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

- Cognitive Walkthrough highlighted a need for clearer prompts and visual cues to guide users
   - Users struggled to locate the map feature, indicating a need for clearer visual prompts
   - Lack of confirmation after ticket purchases created uncertainty, highlighting the importance of feedback messages

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

- Strengths of the App
  - Users found tasks like creating events, finding events on the map, and purchasing tickets easy and intuitive, with most tasks rated highly
  - This confirms the app’s core functionality is effective, providing a strong foundation for further development

- Weakness of the App
  - Users suggested making buttons larger, enhancing the visual design, and improving navigation to view event locations on the map before ticket purchase
  - These changes will improve usability, accessibility, and the overall user experience by making interactions more seamless and visually appealing

- Future Features
  - Requested features included a group chat, contact options for event hosts, a search bar on the map page, and notifications for updates
  - These additions could enhance user engagement, improve communication, and streamline navigation, aligning the app with user expectations for modern event-planning tools
 
- Limitations
  - The small sample size and specific tasks may not fully capture the needs or experiences of all users
  - This highlights the need for more research to validate findings and make better improvements work
