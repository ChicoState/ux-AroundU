# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **Competitive Analysis**: **TripAdvisor** offers a **minimalist app/website** with a user friendly design that makes it easy for people to find local events and information. Itâ€™s effective in displaying where users are on the site and presenting clear information. However, the app does not provide enough **control during the checkout process** and could offer **better support** when issues arise.

* **Heuristic Evaluation**: The evaluation found that **TripAdvisor** excels at guiding users through the site but lacks **error prevention and assistance** during crucial moments.

* **User Preferences**: Users want **a simple and intuitive experience**, where the application helps them navigate seamlessly, particularly during critical actions such as booking or checkout. 

* **Personas and Scenarios**: Confirmed that users value **clear navigation** and **robust error support**, emphasizing ease of use in their day-to-day engagement with local events.

* **Sketches and Diagrams**: Designed features focus on **user control** and **error handling mechanisms** to enhance the overall user experience and ensure smooth interactions with the app.
