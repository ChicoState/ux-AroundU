# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

**Competitive analysis** revealed several opportunities to meet user needs:
- **Local events discovery**: Users struggle to find real-time events nearby that match their interests.
- **User control**: Apps often provide limited customization and error recovery options.

**Heuristic evaluation** identified strengths in site navigation, but weaknesses in:
- **User control** during important actions like event booking.
- **Error prevention** and recovery when mistakes are made.

**New personas and scenarios** highlighted:
- The need for a simple, accessible interface.
- A platform that easily connects users to events based on location and preferences.

**Sketches and diagrams** show the following design features:
- **Improved event filtering** for better personalization.
- **Error handling mechanisms** to enhance user experience and prevent mistakes.
